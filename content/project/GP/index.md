title: Galactic Polymath
summary: I am the founder and CEO of an education studio that translates current research into very high-production, interdisciplinary lessons for grades 5-12 that are free for teachers. With GP, we are pioneering a more equitable concept for educational materials by funding the production of lessons to achieve the outreach needs of organizations that are invested in an informed public, rather than selling to cash-strapped teachers and districts.
