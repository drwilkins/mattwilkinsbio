title: Galactic Polymath
summary: I am the founder and CEO of an education studio that translates current research into very high-production, interdisciplinary lessons for grades 5-12 that are free for teachers. Our goal is to make educational outreach much easier and more impactful for researchers, nonprofits, and sustainable brands, while at the same time making education more equitable and engaging.
