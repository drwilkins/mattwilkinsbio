A scientist, teacher, writer, and pusher of boulders. Matt grew up in Huntsville, AL and is now based out of Nashville, TN. His motivation to found Galactic Polymath (GP) was born from years of frustration as a graduate student and postdoctoral scholar trying to make academic knowledge available to the public. He started and ran a chapter of Nerd Nite, gave guest lectures at public science outreach events, and even founded the No Coast SciComm conference at the University of Nebraska. At every step, it became clear that many of these mechanisms for outreach were most benefitting the groups that already benefit from outreach (science-motivated public in urban centers, near universities). To connect with rural populations, particularly students of color who live in poorer school districts, would require building long-standing relationships, community and capacity building that go far beyond the scope of a scientists' outreach side project. Galactic Polymath is an effort to build long-term capacity to mobilize knowledge that is increasingly trapped and commodified in paywalled Academic journals. GP is built around the idea that publicly-funded research should be made available to the public in a way that is relevant to their lives, and that every student has a right to high quality education materials. Matt wants to live in a world where critical thinking and curiosity are as essential as breathing. He enjoys rock climbing, wildlife photography, and doing silly voices.
