I grew up in Huntsville, AL and now live in Nashville, TN. My motivation to found [Galactic Polymath Education Studio (GP)](https://galacticpolymath.com) was born from years of frustration as a graduate student and postdoctoral scholar trying to make academic knowledge available to the public. I tried a lot of outreach formatsâ€”I wrote fieldwork blogs, started and ran the Lincoln, Nebraska chapter of Nerd Nite for over a year, gave guest lectures at public science outreach events, and founded the [No Coast SciComm conference at the University of Nebraska](http://www.scicommcon.org/). Though I personally had a lot of fun and gained a lot from these experiences, it became clear that I was mostly connecting with folks who were already pretty science-engaged.

Galactic Polymath is an effort to break out of the bubble and to build long-term capacity to mobilize knowledge that is increasingly trapped and commodified in pay-walled academic journals that the broader public can't access or understand. GP is built around the idea that:
1. Publicly-funded research findings should be made available *to everyone for free*, and in a way that's relevant to people's lives.
2. *Every student has a right to high quality education materials.*

I want to live in a world where critical thinking and curiosity are as essential as breathing. I love creative writing, cooking, and making people laugh.

Also supremely lucky to be married to the incredible biologist, data scientist, and all-around wit: [Emily J. Hudson, PhD](https://ejhudson.netlify.app/).
