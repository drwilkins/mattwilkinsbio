event_url: https://www.wnyc.org/story/recycling-wont-eradicate-plastic-pollution/

summary: I was interviewed by DW Gibson on WNYC radio, along with Environmental Sociologist Dr. Rebecca Altman to talk about the sham of plastic recycling and the corporate greenwashing of Keep America Beautiful and other groups who've led us to take sole responsibility for plastic pollution.

I was honored (and intimidated) to be invited as a guest on WNYC live radio during "The Plastic Tour" following the unexpected success of my first foray into writing for the popular press.
