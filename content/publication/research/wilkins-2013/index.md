abstract: Acoustic signals mediate mate choice, resource defense, and species recognition
  in a broad range of taxa. It has been proposed, therefore, that divergence in acoustic
  signals plays a key role in speciation. Nonetheless, the processes driving divergence
  of acoustic traits and their consequences in terms of speciation are poorly understood.
  A review of empirical and comparative studies reveals strong support for a role
  of sexual selection in acoustic divergence, but the possible concomitant influences
  of ecological context are rarely examined. We summarize a conceptual framework for
  testing the relative significance of both adaptive and neutral mechanisms leading
  to acoustic divergence, predictions for cases where these processes lead to speciation,
  and how their relative importance plays out over evolutionary time.

This was the first chapter of my dissertation and the first time I was lead author on a scientific paper. I spent about 2 years doing the literature review, synthesis, and revision of the paper. It has by far had the greatest impact (in terms of citations) of any of my published research.
