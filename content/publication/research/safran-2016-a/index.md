abstract: 'Previous studies have shown that sexual signals can rapidly diverge among
  closely related species. However, we lack experimental studies to demonstrate that
  differences in trait-associated reproductive performance maintain sexual trait differences
  between the two closely related populations, in support for a role of sexual selection
  in speciation. Populations of Northern Hemisphere-distributed barn swallows Hirundo
  rustica are closely related, yet differ in two plumage-based traits: ventral color
  and length of the outermost tail feathers (streamers). Here we provide experimental
  evidence that manipulations of these traits result in different reproductive consequences
  in two subspecies of barn swallow: (H.r. erythrogaster in North America and H.r.
  transitiva in the East Mediterranean). Experimental results in Colorado, USA demonstrate
  that males with (1) darkened ventral coloration and (2) shortened streamers gained
  paternity between two successive reproductive bouts. In contrast, exaggeration of
  both traits improved reproductive performance within H.r. transitiva in Israel:
  males with a combination treatment of darkened ventral coloration and elongated
  streamers gained paternity between two successive reproductive bouts. Collectively,
  these experimental results fill an important gap in our understanding for how divergent
  sexual selection maintains phenotype differentiation in closely related populations,
  an important aspect of the speciation process. This article is protected by copyright.
