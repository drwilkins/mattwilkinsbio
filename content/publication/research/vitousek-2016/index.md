abstract: 'Diverging populations often shift patterns of signal use—a process that
  can contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation. Yet it is not clear why
  most traits gain or lose signal value during divergence. One reason this could occur
  is because changes in the relationship between signals and relevant physiological
  parameters degrade the reliability of a signal, or even change its underlying information
  content. Here we test the hypothesis that the relationship between signal trait
  elaboration and a central component of organismal health—oxidative stress—differs
  across closely related populations that have diverged in signal use and preferences.
  In the recently diverged barn swallow subspecies complex (Hirundo rustica, Family:
  Hirundinidae), different populations use different traits as sexual signals. Two
  of these traits, ventral breast plumage color, and tail streamer length, differ
  markedly between North American H. r. erythrogaster and European H. r. rustica.
  Despite this divergence, variation in ventral plumage color was similarly associated
  with measures of oxidative damage across both populations. However, the directionality
  of these relationships differed between the sexes: darker male barn swallows had
  higher levels of plasma oxidative damage than their lighter counterparts, while
  the opposite relationship was seen in females. In contrast, relationships between
  tail streamer length and measures of oxidative stress were not consistent across
  populations. Some analyses indicated that in European H. r. rustica, where males
  bearing elongated streamers are preferred as mates, longer-streamered males were
  more oxidatively stressed; however, the opposite pattern was suggested in North
  American H. r. erythrogaster. Tail streamer length was not associated with measures
  of oxidative stress in females of either population. Differences in the physiological
  state of stronger signalers across populations and between the sexes may be related
  to costs or constraints on signal elaboration (e.g., biochemical pathways associated
  with melanogenesis), or reflect differences in how signal-mediated social interactions
  influence oxidative stress. Overall, our results suggest that while some phenotypic
  traits appear to be capable of conveying similar physiological information regardless
  of their use as signals, divergence in other phenotypic traits may be associated
  with shifts in their information content.'
