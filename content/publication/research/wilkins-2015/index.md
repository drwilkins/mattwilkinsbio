abstract: Complex signals, involving multiple components within and across modalities,
  are common in animal communication. However, decomposing complex signals into traits
  and their interactions remains a fundamental challenge for studies of phenotype
  evolution. We apply a novel phenotype network approach for studying complex signal
  evolution in the North American barn swallow ( Hirundo rustica erythrogaster ).
  We integrate model testing with correlation-based phenotype networks to infer the
  contributions of female mate choice and maleâ€“male competition to the evolution of
  barn swallow communication. Overall, the best predictors of mate choice were distinct
  from those for competition, while moderate functional overlap suggests males and
  females use some of the same traits to assess potential mates and rivals. We interpret
  model results in the context of a network of traits, and suggest this approach allows
  researchers a more nuanced view of trait clustering patterns that informs new hypotheses
  about the evolution of communication systems.
