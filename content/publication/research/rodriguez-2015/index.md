abstract: 'We use allometric analysis to explore how acoustic signals scale on individual
  body size and to test hypotheses about the factors shaping relationships between
  signals and body size. Across case studies spanning birds, crickets, tree crickets,
  and tree frogs, we find that most signal traits had low coefficients of variation,
  shallow allometric scalings, and little dispersion around the allometric function.
  We relate variation in these measures to the shape of mate preferences and the level
  of condition dependence of signal traits. We find 3 major patterns: 1) signal traits
  associated with closed mate preferences had lower coefficients of variation and
  shallower allometries than signal traits with open preferences, 2) signal traits
  with higher levels of condition dependence had higher coefficients of variation
  and steeper allometries, and 3) the relationship between condition dependence and
  allometry varied with preference shape. We find no difference in coefficient of
  variation or allometry between advertisement and aggressive acoustic signals. Together,
  our findings suggest 2 main conclusions: 1) most acoustic signals do not appear
  to have been selected to function as indicators of body size and 2) an interplay
  between the form of selection and body size-related cost/benefit relationships of
  trait expression has great potential to explain variation in sexual allometries.'
