abstract: Population divergence in geographic isolation is due to a combination of
  factors. Natural and sexual selection may be important in shaping patterns of population
  differentiation, a pattern referred to as 'isolation by adaptation' (IBA). IBA can
  be complementary to the well-known pattern of 'isolation by distance' (IBD), in
  which the divergence of closely related populations (via any evolutionary process)
  is associated with geographic isolation. The barn swallow Hirundo rustica complex
  comprises six closely related subspecies, where divergent sexual selection is associated
  with phenotypic differentiation among allopatric populations. To investigate the
  relative contributions of selection and geographic distance to genome-wide differentiation,
  we compared genotypic and phenotypic variation from 350 barn swallows sampled across
  eight populations (28 pairwise comparisons) from four different subspecies. We report
  a draft whole-genome sequence for H. rustica, to which we aligned a set of 9493
  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using statistical approaches to control
  for spatial autocorrelation of phenotypic variables and geographic distance, we
  find that divergence in traits related to migratory behaviour and sexual signalling,
  as well as geographic distance, together explain over 70% of genome-wide divergence
  among populations. Controlling for IBD, we find 42% of genomewide divergence is
  attributable to IBA through pairwise differences in traits related to migratory
  behaviour and sexual signalling alone. By (i) combining these results with prior
  studies of how selection shapes morphological differentiation and (ii) accounting
  for spatial autocorrelation, we infer that morphological adaptation plays a large
  role in shaping population-level differentiation in this group of closely related
  populations.
