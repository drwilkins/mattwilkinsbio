abstract: Animal communication is often structurally complex and dynamic, with signaler
  and receiver behavior varying in response to multiple environmental factors. To
  date, studies assessing signal dynamics have mostly focused on the relationships
  between select signaling traits and receiver responses in a single environment.
  We use the wolf spider Schizocosa floridana to explore the relationships between
  courtship display form and function across two social contexts (female presence
  vs absence) and two light environments (light vs dark). We use traditional analytical
  methods to determine predictors of copulation success (i.e., signal function) and
  examine these predictors in a structural context by overlaying them on signal phenotype
  networks (Wilkins et al. 2015). This allows us to explore system design principles
  (degeneracy, redundancy, pluripotentiality), providing insight into hypotheses regarding
  complex signal evolution. We found that both social context and light environment
  affect courtship structure, although the predictors of mating success remain similar
  across light environments, suggesting system degeneracy. Contrastingly, the same
  display traits may serve different functions across social environments, suggesting
  pluripotentiality. Ultimately, our network approach uncovers a complexity in display
  structure and function that is missed by functional analyses alone, highlighting
  the importance of systems-based methodologies for understanding the dynamic nature
  of complex signals.
