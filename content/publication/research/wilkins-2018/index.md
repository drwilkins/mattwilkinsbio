abstract: Divergence in acoustic signals plays an important role in the production
  and maintenance of biodiversity in numerous taxa. In this study, we assess patterns
  of acoustic divergence in geographically isolated and sympatric subspecies of barn
  swallows (Hirundo rustica), including analyses of whether song differentiation varies
  with geographical isolation, genetic distance and climatic distance. We provide
  the first description of geographical variation in song among five of six currently
  recognized barn swallow subspecies. Temporal traits describing terminal trills were
  the most distinct song traits among subspecies, adding to growing evidence that
  trills are important in speciation among many birds, insects and fish. Across a
  $∼$6000 km transect of Russia, acoustic distance was predicted by genetic and geographical
  distance, but not climatic distance. We also found no reproductive character displacement
  of song traits in a contact zone between H. r. rustica and H. r. tytleri. Based
  on patterns discovered in this study, we infer an important role of sexual selection,
  genetic and/or cultural drift in the gradual build-up of acoustic divergence, which
  is accelerated in small populations.
