abstract: Understanding the patterns and processes related to sexual dimorphism and
  sex differences in diverse animal taxa is a foundational research topic in ecology
  and evolution. Within the realm of animal communication, studies have traditionally
  focused on male signals, assuming that female choice and maleâ€“male competition have
  promoted sex differences via elaboration of male traits, but selection on females
  also has the potential to drive divergence. Here, we describe female song in barn
  swallows, Hirundo rustica erythrogaster, for the first time, report rates of female
  song production and couple song data with plumage data to explore the relative degree
  to which sex differences in phenotypic traits are consistent with contemporary selection
  on males versus females. During previous intensive study of male song over 2 years,
  we opportunistically recorded songs for 15 females, with matched phenotypic and
  fitness data. We randomly selected 15 high-quality samples from our larger male
  data set to test whether sex differences in song and plumage are more strongly associated
  with fledgling success for females or genetic paternity for males. Analyses included
  35 potential sexual signals including 22 song parameters and 13 plumage traits.
  Outcomes indicate that female songs were used in multiple contexts, restricted primarily
  to the beginning of the breeding season; song traits showed greater sexual differentiation
  than visual plumage traits; and trait correlations with reproductive success in
  females, rather than males, predicted sex-based differences in song and plumage.
  These results are consistent with phylogenetic studies showing that sex-based phenotypic
  differences are driven by changes in females, highlighting the potential role of
  female trait evolution in explaining patterns of sexual differentiation. To achieve
  a better understanding of sex differences and dimorphism, we require comprehensive
  studies that measure the same traits in males and females and their fitness consequences.
