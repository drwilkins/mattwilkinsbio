abstract: Carotenoids can confer somatic and reproductive benefits, but most evidence
  is from captive animal experimentation or single time-point sampling. Another perhaps
  more informative means by which to assess physiological contributions to animal
  performance is by tracking an individual's ability to increase or sustain carotenoids
  or other health-related molecules over time, as these are likely to be temporally
  variable.
