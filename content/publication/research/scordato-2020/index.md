abstract: Migratory divides are proposed to be catalysts for speciation across a diversity
  of taxa. However, it is difficult to test the relative contributions of migratory
  behaviour vs. other divergent traits to reproductive isolation. Comparing hybrid
  zones with and without migratory divides offers a rare opportunity to directly examine
  the contribution of divergent migratory behaviour to reproductive barriers. We show
  that across replicate sampling transects of two pairs of barn swallow (Hirundo rustica)
  subspecies, strong reproductive isolation coincided with a migratory divide spanning
  20 degrees of latitude. A third subspecies pair exhibited no evidence for a migratory
  divide and hybridised extensively. Within migratory divides, overwintering habitats
  were associated with assortative mating, implicating a central contribution of divergent
  migratory behaviour to reproductive barriers. The remarkable geographic coincidence
  between migratory divides and genetic breaks supports a long-standing hypothesis
  that the Tibetan Plateau is a substantial barrier contributing to the diversity
  of Siberian avifauna.
