abstract: Hybrid zones are geographic regions where isolating barriers between divergent
  populations are challenged by admixture. Identifying factors that facilitate or
  inhibit hybridization in sympatry can illuminate the processes that maintain those
  reproduc- tive barriers. We analysed patterns of hybridization and phenotypic variation
  across two newly discovered hybrid zones between three subspecies of barn swallow
  (Hir- undo rustica). These subspecies differ in ventral coloration and wing length,
  traits that are targets of sexual and natural selection, respectively, and are associated
  with genome-wide differentiation in allopatry. We tested the hypothesis that the
  degree of divergence in these traits is associated with the extent of hybridization
  in sec- ondary contact. We applied measures of population structure based on >23,000
  SNPs to confirm that named subspecies correspond to distinct genomic clusters, and
  assessed coincidence between geographic clines for ancestry and phenotype. Although
  gene flow was ongoing across both hybrid zones and pairwise FST between subspecies
  was extremely low, we found striking differences in the extent of hybridization.
  In the more phenotypically differentiated subspecies pair, clines for ancestry,
  wing length and ventral coloration were steep and coincident, suggestive of strong
  isolation and, potentially, selection associated with phenotype. In the less phenotypically
  differentiated pair, gene flow and phenotypic variation occurred over a wide geographic
  span, indicative of weaker isolation. Traits associated with gen- ome-wide differentiation
  in allopatry may thus also contribute to isolation in sympa- try. We discuss potentially
  important additional roles for evolutionary history and ecology in shaping variation
  in the extent hybridization between closely related pairs of subspecies.
