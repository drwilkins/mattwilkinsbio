> The only thing worse than being lied to is not knowing you’re being lied to. It’s true that plastic pollution is a huge problem, of planetary proportions.

### If you want to do something about this:
- Urge your US representatives to support the [Break Free from Plastic Pollution Bill](https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/pollution-act/).
- Fight [plastic preemption laws](https://www.plasticbaglaws.org/preemption) that are sweeping the nation (and prevent local communities from regulating pollution in their backyards)
- If you're in Tennessee, support the [Tennessee CLEAN Act](https://tennesseecleanact.org/)
